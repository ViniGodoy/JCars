Cars project for Java

This is my simulator designed to teach Steering Behaviors in Math&Physics classes for games.

Students must change files inside ```cars.student``` package:

* [Setup.java](./src/cars/student/Setup.java): Returns a list of cars that will be part of the simulation
* [StudentCar.java](./src/cars/student/StudentCar.java): Template car. Does not move.
